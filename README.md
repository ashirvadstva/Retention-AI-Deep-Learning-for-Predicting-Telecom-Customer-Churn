# 🔍 Retention AI: Deep Learning for Predicting Telecom Customer Churn

Welcome to the **"Retention AI"** repository. This project leverages deep learning techniques to predict customer churn in the telecom industry, enabling proactive measures to retain valuable customers.

## 📝 Project Description

In this project, we predict customer churn using features like how long they've been with the company, their monthly bills, and the services they use. Here's what we do:
- **Data Import**: Load and prepare telecom customer data.
- **Feature Engineering**: Transform and scale the data to improve model performance.
- **Model Building**: Create and train a deep learning model using Keras.
- **Evaluation**: Measure how well the model works using key metrics like accuracy and recall.

## 🌟 Key Features

- **📥 Data Loading**: Import customer data from CSV files.
- **🧹 Data Preprocessing**: Clean data by handling missing values, encoding categories, and normalizing features.
- **🧠 Deep Learning**: Use a neural network to predict customer churn.
- **📊 Model Evaluation**: Check the model's accuracy and other performance indicators.

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   \`\`\`bash
   git clone <https://github.com/your-username/Retention-AI>
   \`\`\`
2. **Install Dependencies**:
   \`\`\`bash
   pip install pandas numpy keras scikit-learn
   \`\`\`
3. **Run the Script**:
   \`\`\`bash
   python Retention_AI_Deep_Learning_for_Predicting_Telecom_Customer_Churn.py
   \`\`\`

## 🛠️ Usage Guide
- **Dataset**: Place the dataset file (`Customer_Churn.csv`) in the same folder as the script.
- **Running the Script**: Run the script to process the data, train the model, and see the results.

## ⚠️ Important Considerations
- **Dataset Format**: Make sure your dataset is correctly formatted with all the required columns.
- **Computational Resources**: Training deep learning models can be resource-intensive; ensure your machine is up to the task.
- **Industry-Specific**: The model is tailored for telecom data; adjustments may be needed for other industries.

## 🚧 Limitations
- **Model Focus**: The model is designed for a specific telecom dataset; it might need tuning for other datasets.
- **Model Complexity**: While powerful, deep learning may not always outperform simpler models depending on the data.
